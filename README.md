## 1- About The Idea:

Credit card fraud is a major source of financial trouble not only for consumers, but for banks too. 

Credit card fraud detection is a set of tools and protocols which card issuers use to detect suspicious activity that could indicate a fraud attempt. These tools are generally proactive, aiming to stop credit card fraud before it starts. They also help to prevent financial losses caused by credit card fraud

### Why It's important?

Credit Card Fraud Detection helps to prevent financial losses caused by credit card fraud.

## 2- The Dataset:

The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.
This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.
